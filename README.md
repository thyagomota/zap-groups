# zap-groups

The goal of this project is to catalog WhatsApp groups in Brazil and (possibly) other countries in latin america using web scrapping and public internet discussion groups such as Reddit for example.

WhatsApp provides two ways of group communication: broadcast lists and groups. They both allow users to send messages out to multiple people. Participants of a broadcast list, however, cannot see who else is in the same list and that is the main difference between them and groups. Also, a user only receives a message from a broadcast list if the sender is added to the userâ€™s contact list, making it much more private and secure. Those restrictions do not apply to groups. In this project we are only interested in cataloging groups because we want to later join a selection of groups that we are particularly interested in. To join a WhatsApp group you need an invitation link in the form of: chat.whatsapp.com/group-ID.
