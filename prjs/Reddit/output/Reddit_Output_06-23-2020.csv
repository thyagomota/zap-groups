19/M - Toss me a story or twoHello hello, this is my first post on reddit. Hooray. :)
And I think it's pretty obvious what I'm here for so let's skip that part.

Anyway, I'm a student (who knows for how long still ) in Germany, and I love rambling about basically anything if there's some enthusiasm coming from your side as well. No one likes one-sided things, after all.

Oh, I also never sleep, so don't worry about time zones. 
DM me to sign the totally existing friendship application form, and I'll try not to bite.WhatsApp groupIs there any WhatsApp group for bi guys to chat? I’m keen to join one.32/M/USA Looking for wholesome conversationI don't have any age or gender restrictions with people I want to talk to.
If you are looking for someone genuinely mature and smart and good listener who will always tell you the truth even when you are wrong I would be the right person. 
You can look at my post history if you want to know more about me.
People that works the best for me is someone who has overall positive view of the world or interested in changing their perception and is on their phone often and engaged in conversation. You will learn about lots of interesting things about the world through YouTube videos from me and get smarter everyday .
PM me if you are interested in conversation and I will share my number.21+ International Whatsapp Chat!Hey there! 

We're looking for new people for our big, exciting, and somewhat cheeky chat that can take any topic one can throw at it. When I say big, I mean 50+ people big. It's been a bit dull recently, so new blood is required for the sacrifice! Don't worry, we don't bite. Unless you ask us to.

All are welcome to see if they like our vibe, and maybe become good friends as a fair number of us have:) Just send me a PM with your name, number, where you're from, and tell us a little bit about yourself. After that, you'll be on your way meeting dozens of new people! :)

Have a nice day!25/M/AmericanI’m going to be traveling (hopefully) to Germany next year. I’m starting to try and learn German and I think writing somebody in German would be very helpful. I’ll be visiting a smaller town where my sister in law is from. From what she tells me since it’s not a touristy part most people won’t speak English. So I really want to learn as much German as I can. My German is not very good for now and will probs be depending on google translate a lot but think it would be helpful. I’ve been practicing using Duolingo to start but think I’m going to need more of a conversation to really learn because so far it’s not sticking as well as I had hoped. Some background on me I’m 25 and live in Ohio and I work in Product Management for education technology and I’m currently going back to school to get my MBA. I also love watching international movies and shows so we can chat about that haha. Feel free to DM me here on Reddit.

PM me and we can connect on whatsapp.Where is Waldo? Ariel Salto from Buenos Aires, that isSo, to clarify: a couple years back I stumbled across a WhatsApp group through this sub (for which I am immensely thankful), and in it I met this guy Ariel. Long story short, we got out of touch around last summer, I guess? Sadly, I don't have your contacts any longer, so it's a long shot but if you happen to see this post, please respond. I miss you.WhatsApp Group With Someone from Every Country in the World 

Hello, I am the founder/representative of EPEC (Every Person, Every Country), a group that is dedicated to getting one person from every country in a Whatsapp group. It is also a really good place to make friends from all over the world. We only have 4 countries currently in it and we need more! (The countries we do have are: Ghana, England, Turkey and the Netherlands) Since our founding in September 2019, we have used discord. Now we are working on Whatsapp to get one person from every country in the world on the Whatsapp group. The Discord also operates. If you want to join the Whatsapp group. Just say here what country you're from and I'll give you the link!

Thanks! - Zunaka (Representative for England)Let's increase our English vocabulary togetherI have created a WhatsApp group where I will post a "Word of the Day" every day, along with its meaning. Then, we can try to make sentences using the word.

Im autistic, lgbt, and like cute and nerdy things. I truly hope to meet some other friends and I'm grateful to the ones who have responded. I like stuffed animals, anime, manga, reading, writing, pokrnon, and neopets. Please have some things in common and just want to be friends. I hope you all stay safe!23/F/USA Looking for close friends from anywhereHi! I’m a fashion student in my final semester of college, it’s an associate’s degree but we do basically the amount of work there is for a bachelor’s, haha. So it’s taken me 5 years. But yes I can make clothes! I really love alternative fashion and subcultures, I’m very inspired by goth, Victorian, steampunk, dieselpunk, cyberpunk, outrun, vaporwave, and ravewear. 

I’m also a licensed hairstylist, but I recently quit my job because I feel it’s not very safe during the pandemic. I also really love science and philosophy. I have about a million interests, including dancing, movies, music (especially drum n bass), but I have dreams of maybe returning to university in a few years to study drug chemistry and innovation. 

I’m really sick of where I live, and I’m planning to hopefully find an internship or a job next year in Europe. I love learning languages, I’ve studied many but never become fluent in any of them. Right now, I’ve been trying to learn Spanish in my spare time. 

I’ve recently been trying to work on myself a lot and kind of reorder my life a bit. I got out of a relationship not that long ago and I’ve lost a lot of friends. I really want to better myself and hopefully find my path, especially when this stupid virus calms down. And I’d love to make some close friends. Let me know if you’d like to chat!Hey! Interested in making new friends from all over the world?Hey there, folks!   

We're a supportive and easy-going group of online pals who all met through Reddit and chat daily over WhatsApp -- and we'd *love* to have you join! Waiting for the brave few who are willing to put up with our antics are (aside from awesome new friends, of course) a whole bunch of fun activities, including our own seasonal events, regular Q&As and confessionals, AMAs for newcomers, and meetups for those interested.  

If having bizarre conversations and making long-term friends sounds like your kind of thing, just shoot me a reddit mail with a short description of yourself, as well as the phone number connected to your WhatsApp account (don't forget the country code). We do prefer members of age 18+ to keep it chill and mature.    


Hope to get to know you soon. Cheers!German learners groupHello. I've been learning German by myself for a few months now (probably A2) and I thought it would be helpful to gather a bunch of people who are learning German to help and support each other with any type of question, grammar, translations, corrections and whatnot.

(21+)Hey there everyone! I run an international WhatsApp group with some friends of mine, for people who are 21 or older. It’s an active and vibrant community, with a relaxed atmosphere, where people hang out, talk about whatever they like and do group activities together like playing games on Steam, group calls on Discord and fun events like Secret Santa, Truth or Dare and play Jackbox!  

We are an extremely welcoming and diverse group, no matter your age, nationality or otherwise. We find one of our biggest strengths is the support the group provides to those who need it, when going through something that you otherwise would not be able to go to your friends and family about. It’s an everchanging place of discussion, with approximately 50 members from all around the world, ready to tackle some light small talk or heavier discussions at a moment’s notice. We encourage everyone to talk and let their voice be heard, as long as they are willing to listen to the people they are talking to.  

It does get pretty active, but that’s just how it is supposed to be with a large group of friends! Need a friend to talk hmu24 M hereJoin our group!
